# Capstone-Project *Still Updating*
My Capstone Project I worked on in 2022

It is a simple website comprised of 2 web pages built using html and php. 

The goal of the project would simulate a survey of someone answering questions regarding what they experienced after contracting Covid. 
Then have their results stored within a database that keeps updating with new entries. 
Ending off with a presentation of their results and statistics of the current results shown with a pie chart.
